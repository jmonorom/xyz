          The best country to visit giving you the time of your life. Spending a
          week here can feel like an adventure with the many possibilities

          Trips can vary from a lot of people. You should come prepared and be

          much different.

        <h3>Why should you come here</h3>
        <p>
          [Why people would come to this site? Tourists looking for a fresh new
          look, outside of America trying something new. They will want to see
          whats diverse the world really is. With Cambodia being a third world
          country but so much culture and a different look than so many other
          countries it will be their place to try something new. A question
          people will ask if Cambodia is a dangerous place for tourist since it
          is a third world country. And the answer is no it is actually pretty
          safe for tourist and has been growing in popularity over the years.
          The people there love tourists coming in and meeting new people so you
          will give a warming welcome. We do recommend having a a tour guide
          though because of the language and culture shock you would face coming
          here. Our tour guides will give you a full week to basically try out
          everything. We booked an amazing resort next to the capital, Phnom
          Penh, so you are right next to the streets checking out if you want to
          look around. The next few days we travel and then go let you check out
          at the beach, allowing you to sleep with the waves and famous glowing
          plankton on your view. We also have our tour guides fluent in Khmer
          having them help you with communications.

        <h3>[Activites]</h3>
        <p>
          If you are wondering what activities there are over here, there is so
          much thatâ€™ll leave you with exhaustion and excitement to the end of
          the day. Cambodia has amazing locations and amazing food to try. There
          is very diverse food here to try here that is normally very hard to
          find. The street food is very fresh and famous here, considering that
          they would catch the food straight out the shore plus the food that
          will taste a hundred bucks with huge quantity too will only be a few
          dollars. So many locations you should visit as well. Like the glowing
          planktens at Koh Rong where you see the planktons glow at night at the
          beach and you can swim there as well seeing them move around you.
          Visit Angkor Wat which should be a must see where you can see the
          amazing temples and beautiful sunset hovering around it if you go at
          that time. The amount of museums, buildings, and beaches there will
          make you rush to see all of them. You can also see the elephant
          sanctuary where they let you ride or even swim with them, and plus in
          the cities you will see monkeys walking around like how squirrels are
          in the US. If you have any curiosity of what Cambodia is like you are
          free to call us for our true expierence. Cambodia is a very vibrant
          country and full of rich culture. You go there feeling like you are in
          a tropical jungle then to the city full of traditional music with
          people dancing and doing shows. You see animals from the wild like
          tigers, monkeys, elephants, and panthers common over there. Overall
          Cambodia is a huge place to go see museums, animals, and try out
          foods.

        <p>
          What things do you need here in Cambodia? Cambodia is a third world
          country in Southern Asia. The weather is very humid and tropical so it
          will be hot here but also rainy so have clothes for hot weather and a
          light rain jacket coming here. Also donâ€™t forget about your passport
          and proof that you are from America! You are a tourist and we do not
          want you at all to get lost so donâ€™t ever forget that. Also bring
          sturdy sandals and shoes when coming here. We do go straight to
          jungles to the beach and the surroundings are very rough! The cost of
          spending here is really low because of the currency, having 1 US
          dollar is equal to 4000 riel which is basically able to get you a meal
          with just a dollar. Overall we tell you these things to really help
          you. Itâ€™s our duty to have the most fun in Cambodia and also be
          prepared too so nothing bad happens to you. We hope you will join us
          in our adventure!
